# PDCA Cycle

A loop for complex work: Plan → Do → Check → React → (repeat or done).

**Production code changes should follow the PDCA cycle.** REPL exploration is always permitted in every phase — it never changes production code.

**Use PDCA when:**
- Plan has more than ~5 checkboxes
- Work touches more than ~3 files
- Architectural changes or multi-component features

**Skip PDCA for:** Quick bug fixes, typos, single-file changes. Use `-` as the phase.

### Key Coding Principles (apply in every phase)

These principles guide planning, implementation, and review:

- **DDRY** (Decomplected Don't Repeat Yourself) — it's not enough to just extract shared code. Shared code must be decomplected and composable: one role, explicit dependencies, pure where possible. DRY without decomplection creates abstractions that braid unrelated concerns together.
- **Fail-fast** — fix the source of missing data, don't route around it. No `(or x default)` for data that should be present. No fallback code paths in production.
- **TDD** — write/update tests before implementation.
- **Decomplection** — one fold: each thing has one role, one concept, one dimension. State is never simple. All dependencies explicit.

All principles apply in every phase, but emphasis shifts: **Plan** → decomplection + risk-assessment. **Do** → fail-fast + TDD. **Check** → DDRY scan + testing-patterns.

See [decomplection-first-design](../decomplection-first-design/) and [error-handling-patterns](../error-handling-patterns/) for details.

## The Loop

```
┌──→ Plan ──→ Do ──→ Check ──→ React ──┐
│                                        │
│    (gaps found → back to Plan)         │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
              (no gaps → done, pop stack)
```

This is a loop, not a linear sequence. It repeats until the work is complete with no remaining gaps.

## Phases

### Plan (`pdca:plan`)

Use Claude's native plan mode. The plan is automatically posted to the GitHub issue when you exit plan mode.

**Requirements:**
1. Use Claude's plan mode to analyze the codebase and write the plan
2. Include a `## Core Assumptions` section — facts the plan depends on
3. On ExitPlanMode, the plan is auto-posted to the active GitHub issue (backgrounded)
4. If `## Decomplection Review` and `## Risk Assessment` sections are missing, the exit gate will instruct you to dispatch two independent review agents (in parallel) that cold-read the plan — these write to temp files to avoid conflicts, then you merge them into the plan
5. The derisk result file must show LOW/NONE/ACCEPTED risk to pass the gate

**Issue body format** (problem first — see [documentation-maintenance](../documentation-maintenance/)):
```markdown
## Problem
[What's wrong or missing]

## Repro (if applicable)
[Minimal code or steps]

## Impact
[Who's affected]
```

Post the task list and implementation plan as the **first comment**, not in the body.

**Every PDCA issue must end with:**
```markdown

## PDCA Reminder
This issue follows the PDCA cycle. When all tasks above are complete:
1. Commit all Do-phase changes (creates a checkpoint to build from or finalize)
2. Update the issue label from `pdca:do` → `pdca:check`
3. Update `.claude/issue-stack.md` phase from `do` → `check`
4. Enter plan mode
5. Review all changes against this plan and post a gap analysis as a comment
6. Evaluate all touched files for purity violations — present for user approval
7. Run fallback code scan (missing data fallbacks + refactoring fallbacks)
8. Reflect on lessons learned during Do — save durable insights to auto-memory
9. Present the gap analysis to the user and transition to `react`
Do not close this issue or declare done until the full cycle completes.
```

### Do (`pdca:do`)

Execute the plan by dispatching sub-agents for each task. Update issue checkboxes and add comments as work completes.

**Halt-on-violated-assumptions:** Before or during each task, verify the core assumptions listed in the plan. If any assumption is wrong, **STOP immediately** — do not attempt workarounds. Post a comment explaining which assumption was violated and what was actually observed, then transition back to `pdca:plan`.

**What counts as a violated assumption:**
- You read a reference implementation and discover it works differently than the plan describes
- A dependency, API, or data shape doesn't match what the plan expects
- The plan says "follow the pattern from X" but X's pattern is fundamentally different
- Any fact the plan relies on turns out to be false

**The natural temptation is to adapt and keep going. Do not.** The plan was approved as a whole — if its foundation is wrong, the entire approach may need rethinking. Noting "I see this works differently" and continuing is the failure mode. STOP means stop.

### Do → Check transition

When all Do-phase tasks are complete, **commit all changes before transitioning to Check.** This creates a clean checkpoint:

- If Check/React reveals gaps that loop back to Plan, you have a solid base to build from — no risk of losing Do-phase work.
- If Check/React declares done, the commit is the completed work.

```bash
git add <changed files>
git commit -m "feat: <description of what was implemented>"
gh issue edit #N --remove-label "pdca:do" --add-label "pdca:check"
```

### Check (`pdca:check`)

After the Do→Check commit, **enter plan mode** and produce a gap analysis as a comment on the issue:

- Tasks completed vs tasks planned
- Deviations from the plan (intentional or accidental)
- New issues discovered during implementation
- Quality concerns (tests missing, edge cases unhandled)
- Purity violations in touched files — flag hidden state, impure functions, missing `!` suffixes
- **DDRY scan** — check for DRY extractions that complect unrelated concerns. Shared functions should have one role and compose cleanly. If an abstraction serves multiple callers by doing multiple things, it violates DDRY — split it.
- **Fallback code scan** — run `git diff` against the branch point and scan changed Clojure files for two categories of fallback:
  1. **Missing data fallbacks**: `(or <expr> <literal>)`, `(get m k default)`, `(when-not x ...)` with fallback body, `(try ... (catch ... <default>))` — should the data be present at the source instead?
  2. **Refactoring fallbacks**: conditional dispatch between old and new code paths, deprecated function wrappers that forward to new implementations, feature flags gating old vs new behavior — if we're refactoring, cut over cleanly. Don't keep both paths alive.
  Flag violations for resolution before React.
- Documentation updated for any user-visible features

**Lessons learned** — reflect on the Do phase. These are reusable insights, not issue-specific details:
- Planning heuristics that worked or failed
- Execution patterns worth repeating
- Pitfalls to avoid next time
- Process improvements

Save durable lessons to auto-memory. Post ephemeral observations in the issue comment only.

Plan mode is used intentionally — Check is read-only analysis.

### React (`pdca:react`)

Present the gap analysis to the user. **This is a decision point, not a planning activity.**

- **No gaps / all acceptable** → Done. Pop the issue from the stack.
- **Gaps need fixing** → Loop back to Plan. User indicates which gaps matter.
- **Defer gaps** → Create follow-up issues. Pop the current issue.

React never produces a plan — it decides *whether* to re-plan. Do not auto-resolve gaps — the user decides what matters.

## Phase Transitions

Always update in this order:
1. **GitHub issue label** — source of truth
2. **`.claude/issue-stack.md`** — local cache for hooks

```bash
gh issue edit #N --remove-label "pdca:do" --add-label "pdca:check"
```

---

## Integration with Plugin Hooks

The plugin provides automation hooks for PDCA transitions:

| Hook | Event | What it does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `pdca-plan-on-enter-plan-mode.sh` | PreToolUse:EnterPlanMode | Transitions label to `pdca:plan`, explains required sections |
| `plan-to-issue.sh` | PreToolUse:ExitPlanMode | Requires active issue, posts plan as comment (backgrounded) |
| `plan-review-gate.sh` | PreToolUse:ExitPlanMode | Checks for `## Decomplection Review` and `## Risk Assessment` markers, verifies derisk result |
| PostToolUse:Task | PostToolUse:Task | Prompts Check phase when Do tasks complete |
| Stop | Stop | Checks PDCA phase and prompts next action |
